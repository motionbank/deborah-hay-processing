    <marker>fred & ginger / read space</title>
    <content>I appear at the edge of the stage as the last few audience members take their seats. My behavior is matter-of-fact. I have a lot of choices to make in advance of my entrance. I decide on my entrance site and the direction I will travel in relation to the audience, plus where that path will end. Then the light fades. The moment the light returns I step onto the stage, walking in a stride and style not mine, as foreign as a foreign accent, recognizable but odd. The path is a singular broad curve that ends in a slightly accelerated little curl, leaving me facing the portal through which I stepped onto the stage.</content>
    <notes>
      <note-item>Nothing about my performance ends at the end of the curl.</note-item>

    <marker>link to portal</title>
    <content>I am held by an imagined cord linking me to the portal.</content>
    <notes>
      <note-item>I attend to the exactness of the single broad curve so that when I face my entrance site it is as if I complete the stringing of an archerâ€™s bow.</note-item>
      <note-item>I deliberately create this space within a space, separating me from the audience.</note-item>

    <marker>ancient voice #1</title>
    <content>An ancient voice quietly advises me to remember the audience as well as the space beyond my tightly contained space.</content>
    <notes>
      <note-item>The ancient voice is me from 10,000 years ago bringing that possibility into the present.</note-item>
      <note-item>My choice to perform this material requires catastrophic acts of perception. I associate catastrophic with images of great loss. The magnitude and reoccurrence of choreographed behavior that I need to first recognize and then dis-attach from, again and again, is a personal loss of tremendous proportion.</note-item>

    <marker>break cord</title>
    <content>In response to the guidance received, I select the right moment to break the string and notice at once how the inclusion of the theater and my audience enlarges my dancing. It is like a real opening, and I begin again.</content>

    <marker>joy & sorrow #1</title>
    <content>My body is still while joy and sorrow wash across my face like a stream of instances. When not streaming, my face may briefly return to normalcy, or it may sustain a single reflection of joy/sorrow for longer moments.</content>
    <notes>
      <note-item>I am not limited to my personal experience of joy and sorrow. It is a relief to know that it is in and about the audience, this theater, and the world beyond its doors.</note-item>
      <note-item>As I perform, I try to remove my tendency to embody the images I use to describe the movement material.</note-item>

    <marker>wordless song</title>
    <content>I sing a wordless song that arises from and combines joy and sorrow into a single melody that resonates through my bones. Barely suppressing a sense of personal history, my face reflects the transience of joy and sorrow.</content>
    <notes>
      <note-item>I hear the song as my voice leaves my body. I am intentionally unguarded because I rarely allow myself to partake in unprotected experiences.</note-item>
      <note-item>As I perform, I try to remove my tendency to embody the images I use to describe the movement material.</note-item>
      <note-item>I am not translating the written language into movement, i.e., joy and sorrow. I actually aspire toward a bodily speechlessness by noticing my visual field, which includes what I can and cannot see, as well as minute associative instances that rise spontaneously.</note-item>

      <note-item>I understand that joy and sorrow are always present. I do not have to instigate them.</note-item>
